### Disaster Response Pipeline Project

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyse disaster data from [Appen](https://appen.com/) and build a machine learning pipeline, that uses NLTK and scikit-learn's Pipeline, to output a model that classify messages sent during disasters into 36 categories (e.g. Medical Help, Medical Products, Offer, etc).
